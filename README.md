# mBot development emulator

### IDE Support

Tested in following IDEs:

- [Dev-C++ 5.11 IDE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
- [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) 2019.1

Write your mBot code in the mBotProgram.cpp. The rest of the project is the emulator itself -
headers pretending we are on the mBot and the emulator implementation.
